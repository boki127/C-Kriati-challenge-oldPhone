## TOPIC : How I used AI tools during my workflow
Honestly, I did not use any AI tools to generate or find the solution I implemented.
However, I did use AI to enhance other aspects of the project, mainly for learning and support purposes.
Hereâ€™s how AI helped me during development:
1. Learning and Familiarization : To get familiar with the C# language, .net framework, and xunit test framework.
2. Clarifying Requirements : To better understand some terms in the problem prompt properly, to ensure that I fully understand the requirement.
3. Syntax Assistance : To confirm how to implement structures (like Stack or Array) when I already knew the logic but needed syntax reminders.
4. OOP and C# Structure Review : To refresh my understanding of OOP concepts (class types, namespaces, and keywords) in C#.
5. Testing Guidance : To help me properly construct xUnit test cases.
6. Documentation and Readability : To help me properly construct readme.md file, what to include and how to organize the file.

# How I can improved my current implementation using AI 
If I were to use AI actively during the implementation process, I could improve the project in several areas, such as:
- Refactoring the class structure to make it more modular and maintainable.
- Generating more edge test cases automatically for stronger coverage.
- Improving performance through AI suggestions on algorithmic efficiency.
- Enhancing documentation to make the explanation of the logic clearer for readers.
- Automating code review for naming consistency, readability, and style.

# AI tools used during development, including the prompts or instructions to those tools.
Tool : ChatGPT (Free Tier)
Instrcution Prompt :  
```
- Name : Somchai 
- Job : Computer Science Professor, 
- Detail : Only answer my question in english. Answer the question to make com-sci bachelor easily understand. The answer must simple and clear without emoji or sugar coating. Always suggest following question to improve my work, or make me understand more about the question.
```
- Prompts Used:
```
  1. Explain me, what is a method class in c#, with example.
  2. I am working on project... {like in the description in the first readme.mb}, How should I construct readme file, provide me topisc with example.
  3. {my version of project description}, Help me re-write it more formally.
  4. {Project description}, give me some example simple xunit test cases
  5. 
```
