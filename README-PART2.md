## TOPIC : How I used AI tools during my workflow
Honestly, I didn't use any AI tools to find the solution that I implemented, but using it to ask other aspects around the project to improve the quality of the code.
1. To make me familiar to the C# language, .net framwork, and xunit test framework.
2. To understand some terms in the problem prompt properly, to maked me understand more about the requirement.
3. To ask about syntaxes that I know the logic but cannot write the code properly like Stack and Array in C#.
4. To remind me some aspects of the OOP knowledge like types of the class, structure of the language such as Namespace, Class, and Keywords.
5. To help me properly construct the xunit test.
6. To help me properly construct readme.md file, like what I should and should not put in the file.
