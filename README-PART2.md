## TOPIC : How I used AI tools during my workflow
Honestly, I didn't use any AI tools to find the solution that I implemented, but using it to ask other aspects to improve the quality of the code.
1. To make me familiar to the C# language, .net framwork, and xunit test framework.
2. To understand some terms in the problem prompt, to understand more about the requirement or the prompt provided.
3. To ask about syntax that I know the logic but cannot write the code properly like Stack and Array in C#.
4. To remind me of the OOP knowledge like types of the class, structure of the language such as Namespace, Class, and Keywords 

# How I can improved my current implementation
  I think I can improved in many places and aspects.

# AI tools used during development, including the prompts or instructions to those tools.
